Currently working on Portals. Even per Abramov, they can be implemented multiple ways. Currently looking at this stackoverflow post: [React Modal](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35623656/how-can-i-display-a-modal-dialog-in-redux-that-performs-asynchronous-actions/35641680)    
Also have been reading and re-reading the sparse information given by the react docs [React Portals](https://reactjs.org/docs/portals.html)
